# miranda-compiler

Just trying my hand at implementing a Miranda compiler following The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages by Simon L. Peyton Jones.

I've chosen to implement my compiler in Haskell as opposed to Miranda since I'm more comfortable with Haskell and it offers powerful parsing libraries (parsec).
